# Dev-only entrypoint for the Dockerfile `dev-run` stage.
#
# Runs two cooperating processes against the bind-mounted /app/src so that
# editing a .java (or resource) file on the host hot-reloads the running app:
#
#   1. A background mtime-poll loop that recompiles src -> target/classes when
#      a source file changes, then touches the DevTools trigger file. We poll
#      mtimes (find -newer) rather than using inotify/entr because inotify
#      events do not cross the macOS Docker Desktop bind mount, but file mtimes
#      do. The poll is cheap when idle and only pays the mvn cost on a real edit.
#
#   2. The app itself via `mvn spring-boot:run`. With spring-boot-devtools on
#      the classpath, DevTools watches target/classes and does its fast in-JVM
#      context restart when the trigger file appears. Fork stays enabled (the
#      default) — disabling it would disable DevTools.
